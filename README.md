*"The test begins...... now"* -- The Flaming Lips
  
  
Step 1
======
Fork this repository and create a topic branch named after you.  For example, my topic branch would be called 'chadkouse'.

Step 2
======
Working on your topic branch, use a [cocoapod](http://cocoapods.org/) to solve the riddle in the root view controller.
Solving the riddle will make the app crash unless you have completed Step 3 as well.

Step 3
======
Update the UITableViewDatasource and UITableViewDelegate to reveal the final instruction


**Bonus:** Our test app isn't quite ready for iPad yet.  Please modify the project so that it will run the iPhone version on an iPad.
